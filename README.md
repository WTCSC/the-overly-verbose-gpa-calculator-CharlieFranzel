**Overly Verbose GPA Calculator**

This is a simple Python program that calculates a GPA based on a list of grades. The user enters their grades, and the program checks that each one is between 0.0 and 4.0. Then it calculates the overall GPA and a semester GPA by splitting the list in half.

The program also asks the user for a goal GPA and checks if they can reach it by improving one grade to a 4.0.
